        bio: `Christian is an accomplished radiopharmaceutical scientist with over 15 years of experience in basic, translational, and Phase I clinical research. Christian studied in Germany and Australia obtaining a post-graduate degree from the Technical University of Munich and a doctoral degree from the University of Melbourne with a focus on medicinal and radiochemistry.

        Christian brings comprehensive experience with a range of diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes. He has a strong background in development of small molecule diagnostic probes, and antibody-based conjugates for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. As the Senior Research Scientist, he has led pre-clinical evaluation of over 15 novel radiopharmaceuticals and oversaw radiochemistry aspects of 10 Phase I clinical bioimaging trials. He is currently facilitating several multi-centre trials in Australia in collaboration with global pharmaceutical companies.`,
