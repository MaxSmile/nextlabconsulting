Christian is an accomplished radiopharmaceutical scientist with over 15 years of experience in basic, translational, and Phase I clinical research. Christian studied in Germany and Australia obtaining a post-graduate degree from the Technical University of Munich and a doctoral degree from the University of Melbourne with a focus on medicinal and radiochemistry.

Christian brings comprehensive experience with a range of diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes. He has a strong background in development of small molecule diagnostic probes, and antibody-based conjugates for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. As the Senior Research Scientist, he has led pre-clinical evaluation of over 15 novel radiopharmaceuticals and oversaw radiochemistry aspects of 10 Phase I clinical bioimaging trials. He is currently facilitating several multi-centre trials in Australia in collaboration with global pharmaceutical companies.

He has established CRO activities for commercial partners and managed technology transfer of FDA and TGA compliant radiopharmaceutical processes bridging the gap between academic research and commercial engagement. Over the course of his career, Christian has collaborated closely with leaders in the field and cultivated a valuable network of advising experts.

Christian is an active member of the scientific community with over 30 peer-reviewed research articles, two patents, and regular scientific presentations at international meetings and the IAEA. Christian is currently completing establishment of a new centre for translational radiopharmaceutical research and development, liaising with equipment suppliers and directing capital works.

His background, and years of experience in radiochemistry automation as a R&D consultant in the radiopharmaceutical industry, make Christian a valuable resource for radiopharmaceutical R&D, process design
