Dr. Maggie Aulsebrook holds over eight years of experience in the radiopharmaceutical sector. She specialises in the development and clinical translation of radiopharmaceuticals in regulated environments. Throughout her career, Maggie has delivered a number of first-in-human diagnostic (PET and SPECT) and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals to the clinic. Her experience in radiopharmaceutical development spans the entire drug development pipeline from initial radiochemistry studies through to regulatory approvals.
Maggie has worked in Europe, the United States and Australia with extensive experience in FDA and TGA licenced environments with experience in the supply of sterile radiopharmaceuticals in the private and public health sectors.
