Harris boasts over a decade of hands-on experience in utilizing cyclotrons within the realm of Nuclear Medicine. Positioned at one of Australia’s largest and oldest public hospital cyclotron facilities, he leads a highly capable team of scientists and engineers tasked with operating and maintaining the hospital’s two cyclotrons and Solid Target Lab. This lab serves as a crucial supplier of key isotopes utilized in both research and medical imaging, including F18, Cu64, Ga68, Y86, Zr89, and I124, catering to needs across Australia.

With his seasoned expertise, Harris specializes in the development, purification, and quality control of cyclotron-based isotopes. Often presenting on the subject, he has pioneered multiple innovative isotopes along with the specialized targetry necessary for their production.

 

Over the years, Harris has gained comprehensive knowledge of all facets of day-to-day cyclotron operations, ranging from routine maintenance and troubleshooting of to staffing requirements and budgetary considerations, demonstrating his holistic understanding of the operational landscape.

In addition to his operational proficiency, Harris has overseen various cyclotron facility and cleanroom design initiatives. Notably, he recently led an upgrade project for an existing solid target lab, effectively doubling its isotope production capacity. Furthermore, he managed the development of a Grade C radiopharmaceutical production cleanroom, featuring a dedicated dispensing hotcell and the capability to accommodate eight radiosynthesis modules.
