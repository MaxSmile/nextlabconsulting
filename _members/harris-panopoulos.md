Harris brings over a decade of hands-on experience in the use of cyclotrons in the field of Nuclear Medicine. Based at one of Australia’s largest and oldest public hospital cyclotron facilities, he leads a highly capable team of scientists and engineers that is responsible for the operation and upkeep of the hospital’s two cyclotrons and Solid Target Lab, which provides Australia wide supply of key isotopes used for research and medical imaging such as F18, Cu64, Ga68, Y86, Zr89, and I124.

Harris is a seasoned expert in the development, purification and QC of cyclotron based isotopes. Often presenting on the subject, he has developed multiple novel isotopes and the specialized targetry to produce them.

Through his years on the job, Harris understands all aspects of day to day cyclotron operations, from complete maintenance and troubleshooting to staffing requirements and budgetary considerations, and everything in between.

In addition to his operational expertise, Harris has also managed cyclotron facility and cleanroom design projects. Most recently, an upgrade to an existing solid target lab, doubling its isotope production capacity, and a Grade C radiopharmaceutical production cleanroom, with a dedicated dispensing hotcell and capacity for eight radiosynthesis modules.

Harris holds Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Physics from the University of Melbourne.
