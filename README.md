## Technology

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

### Why Next.js?

- **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js allows us to pre-render pages on the server, which can lead to better performance and SEO.
- **Static Generation:** We can generate HTML in advance for pages that can be cached and served by CDN.
- **Flexibility:** Next.js gives us the ability to build a hybrid application that contains both server-rendered and statically generated pages.
